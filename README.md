Migration Tools
===============

These tools were developed in order to clean or prep our legacy EAD and MARC XML for migration to ArchivesSpace. We've tried to insert plenty of comments, but let us know if something isn't clear!

Guidelines
----------

  1. Our audience is archivists--not programmers. 
  2. Comment generously. See #1.
  3. Don't be so Pythonic that other folks can't decipher what you've done. See # 1.
  4. Don't make public anything that's supposed to be private.
